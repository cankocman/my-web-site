                    {`  Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that uses a chain of
                    blocks to store and manage data. Each block in the chain contains a number of
                    transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, the data it contains
                    cannot be altered. This makes the technology highly secure and tamper-proof. `}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {` A blockchain network consists of a number of nodes, which are computers or other
                    devices that participate in the network. Each node maintains a copy of the
                    entire blockchain, and when a new transaction is added to the network, it is
                    broadcast to all the nodes. `}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {` The process of adding a new block to the chain begins with the creation of a new
                    block, which is a collection of one or more transactions. The block is then
                    broadcast to the network, and each node adds it to its copy of the blockchain
                    after verifying the transactions it contains. `}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {` This process of verifying transactions is done through a consensus mechanism,
                    which is a set of rules that the nodes in the network use to agree on the state
                    of the blockchain. One of the most popular consensus mechanisms used in
                    blockchain networks is called proof-of-work (PoW). In a PoW-based network, nodes
                    must solve a complex mathematical puzzle in order to add a new block to the
                    chain. This process is called mining, and the node that solves the puzzle first
                    is rewarded with a certain number of cryptocurrency. `}

                  <p>
                    {` Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the data it contains becomes part
                    of the permanent record of the network. This makes the technology useful for a
                    variety of applications, such as digital currencies, smart contracts, and supply
                    chain management. `}

                  <p>
                    {`  One of the key benefits of blockchain technology is its decentralization. Since
                    the data is stored across a large number of nodes, there is no central point of
                    control or failure. This makes the technology highly resistant to tampering or
                    hacking. Additionally, the use of a consensus mechanism ensures that the network
                    is able to reach agreement on the state of the blockchain, even in the presence
                    of malicious actors. `}

                    {` It's important to keep in mind that the use of Blockchain is not limited to the
                    one most well-know implementation of it which is the one used for Bitcoin, and
                    it has various implementation with different use cases. `}
